                    My first trimester was not a so good time for me and my husband, because i was seriously sick with lots of things.The vomiting,
                    fever,dizziness were all bad on me.I think I will say I don't like that phrase of my pregnancy journey.

                    My second trimester is presently a very good one.I have been having a good time with myself and the baby. There haven't really
                    been any negative experience with my health, I have been feeling strong lately and absolutely okay.
